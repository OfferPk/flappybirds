# Hybrid Game Architecture Design

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for integrating Flappy Bird with combat features and a Spin to Earn game into a single application with login capabilities, leaderboard functionality, and hybrid storage.

## Core Components

### 1. Main Application Container
- Single-page application with mode switching
- Common UI elements (header, navigation, footer)
- Game mode selection interface
- Responsive design for all devices

### 2. Game Modules
- **Flappy Bird Combat Module**: Enhanced Flappy Bird game with shooting mechanics
- **Spin to Earn Module**: Interactive wheel spinning game with rewards
- **Common Game Utilities**: Shared functions, assets, and utilities

### 3. User Management System
- Optional login/registration system
- User profile management
- Session handling
- Authentication state management

### 4. Data Management System
- **Local Storage Layer**: For offline gameplay and data persistence
- **Sync Manager**: Prepares for future Firebase integration
- **Data Models**: User profiles, game scores, achievements, etc.

### 5. Leaderboard System
- Score tracking and ranking
- Top players display
- Personal statistics

## Data Flow

### User Authentication Flow
1. User opens application
2. User can play without login (anonymous mode)
3. User can register/login to save progress
4. On login, local data is synced with user profile
5. User remains logged in via local session storage

### Game Mode Switching Flow
1. User selects game mode from main menu
2. Application loads appropriate game module
3. Game state is preserved when switching modes
4. Common data (coins, achievements) is shared between modes

### Data Storage and Sync Flow
1. Game data is always saved to local storage first
2. When online and logged in, data is queued for sync
3. Sync manager handles conflicts with server data
4. Offline changes are applied when connection is restored

## Offline Capabilities
- Full gameplay in both modes without internet
- Local leaderboard when offline
- Local storage of user progress and scores
- Automatic sync when connection is restored

## Future Firebase Integration
- Authentication will use Firebase Auth
- User profiles will be stored in Firestore
- Leaderboard data will sync with Firestore
- Real-time updates for leaderboard changes

## Responsive Design Considerations
- Fluid layout adapting to screen sizes
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Keyboard controls for desktop
- Orientation handling for mobile devices

## Performance Considerations
- Asset preloading for smooth gameplay
- Efficient rendering using Canvas
- Minimal DOM manipulation during gameplay
- Throttled data saving to prevent performance issues
